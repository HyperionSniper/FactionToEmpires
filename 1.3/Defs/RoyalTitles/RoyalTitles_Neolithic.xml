    <description>The title of elder may be used to characterize highly respected members of a tribe. Depending on the size and political structure of the tribe, the title may not officially exist in some tribes. An outsider may be granted this title and a place in a tribal union council only with the greatest of honor.\n\nWithin more organized tribes, an elder often holds a middle-level position of authority and is usually elected. In other tribes, an elder may hold a culturally significant role or act as an instructor. In this case, a tribesman often becomes an elder through high skill in a craft or art, or through general knowledgability.</description>

    <label>chief</label>
    <description>The title of chief may be used to characterize the most respected people in a tribe. Depending on the size and political structure of the tribe, the title may not officially exist in some tribes.
