--- Original Description ---
[Overview]

You can make any faction or race to empire.
Of course, you can also set just some factions you want.
A race added as a mod? Available.
Now you can become a member of their royal family.


[Detail]

The faction that became an empire gives a quest that gives a royal favor.
They will sometimes come to lodging with quest.
Once you get their title, you can trade with them and call the escort.
They will naturally appear in your game with royal titles.
The pawns of each empire that comes as a guard or guest, were automatically selected from the pawns owned by the faction and developed to show the appropriate pawns.
I've put a lot of effort into this automation. This will feel natural.

[Caution]

Save file is not compatible.
Changing options does not apply to save games.
A game restart is required after changing the options.

So, how to apply this mod is as follows.
(* very important)
1. Set the options for this mod in Options.
2. Restart rimworld.
3. Start a new game.


This mod should be arranged after all faction mods.

[DLC Royalty]
[Other faction mods]
[This Mod]


If a mod faction doesn't wear vanilla clothes and doesn't have a royal Apparel, you can't resolve that race's mood debuff, so you should turn off the "royal need royal's apparel" in the options.

[Known issues]

Some factions can cause a bug where the content of the quest does not appear.
To fix this, set to 'Empire : Bug Resolution' in the options.
If this doesn't work. Disable this faction in the options to avoid becoming an empire.

Turn off rimsenal's 'make empire' option. If you make it an Empire, you will get an error.

[Recommand mods]
